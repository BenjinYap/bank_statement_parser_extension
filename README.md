# bank_statement_parser_extension

A chrome extension written in Svelte that parses out all the credit card line items from a bank webpage and allows me to edit the items in an excel-like UI before copying and pasting it into an actual excel sheet.

## TODO

* saving an entry after editing an amount without hitting enter triggers an error.
* add a delete to main rows
* add original item to everything
* make total only update on amount "save"
* automatic td detect
